# RIMO - 
In many practical studies, among the outcomes Y1, . . . , YK , one or multiple of them are
incomplete. In randomized experiments, simply ignoring the missing outcomes may lead to
statistical inference not finite population exact anymore. In matched observational studies,
people routinely exclude study subjects with missing outcomes, which would substantially
the statistical power due to discarding many study samples.
These framework is for testing post-prediction missing data imputation
