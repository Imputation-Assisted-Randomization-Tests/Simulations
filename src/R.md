# Using the `rimo` Python Package in R with `reticulate`

Follow the steps below to use the `rimo` Python package in R using the `reticulate` package.

## 1. Install and Load the `reticulate` Package in R

If you haven't already, you'll need to install and load the `reticulate` package in R:

```R
install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

## 2. Use `reticulate` to Install Your Python Package

You can use the `py_install()` function from `reticulate` to install Python packages. To install your `rimo` package:

```R
py_install("rimo")
```

## 3. Import Your Python Package in R

Now, you can import your Python package and use its functions in R:

```R
rimo <- import("rimo")

# Example: If your package has a function named 'retrain_test'
result <- rimo$retrain_test(...)
```

Replace the ... with the appropriate arguments for the `retrain_test` function.

## 4. Accessing the Results

You can access the results and use them just like you would in Python. For example:

```R
print(result$reject)
print(result$p_values)
```

## Note

- Ensure that the Python environment used by `reticulate` in R has all the necessary dependencies for your `rimo` package.
  
- You can specify which Python to use with `reticulate` by setting it with the `use_python()` or `use_condaenv()` functions before importing or running any Python code.
  
- Remember that when you're using Python functions in R, you'll need to follow Python's syntax and conventions. For instance, Python uses zero-based indexing, while R uses one-based indexing.
